                I enjoy singing, writing, playing/listening to music, basketball, snowboarding, cooking, and meeting new people. I've been singing and playing the guitar since I was very young. I write original songs and create chords with them. I also participate in choir and local shows/competitions.

                I belive that fulfilling your potential is the most crucial factor in life, and that trying in everything you do is important; whether it be academics to what you wear.
